## Reporting a Vulnerability

Instead, report it responsibly using one of the following channels:

- Or open a **private security advisory** via [GitHub Security Advisories](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)

## Response Expectations

- You will receive an acknowledgment **within 48 hours**.  
- We will provide a progress update at least **once per week** until the issue is resolved.  
- If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix and release a patched version as quickly as possible.  
- If the report is declined (e.g., not a security issue), we will provide a clear explanation.

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask you to:  
- Give us reasonable time to fix the issue before public disclosure.  
- Avoid testing attacks on production systems that could impact users.  

Weâ€™re committed to maintaining the security of **Intelligentable** and protecting our users.
